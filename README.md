# Minesweeper Bot
 Attempting to create a minesweeper solver
 
 Will be using simple logical methods when possible and use probability calculations when necessary.

To run the code as it is so far run python main.py row col num_mines grid_size
Where the dimensions of the grid are (row, col) there are num_mines mines and each cell in the grid is grid_size pixels
